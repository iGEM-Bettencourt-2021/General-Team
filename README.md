# General Team Repository

## Information about the team and its structure
This is where you want to start if this is your first time visiting our page. Everything in this repository will be general and apply to all team members, as well as include information regarding the structure, and organization of the GitHub page and documentation on how to use the software we produce. We believe that it is important for the public, as well as other iGEM teams to be able to follow our progression and thought-process throughout this competition.

We have split into 4 main teams, each team consisting of a lead and their respective team members. The level of participation of each member is broken down into three categories;
- Primary
- Secondary
- Tertiary

Where primary and secondary members form the backbone of the team, and tertiary members are there to assist the team if needed. We chose this structure to dilute the workload, and is an attempt at increasing our efficiency throughout the competition. Below are the leads of each team, and members with a participation level of secondary or higher.

## Primer on GitHub and how we intend to organize our page

The GitHub will serve as a project management platform for us to keep track of the level of involvement, assign tasks and keep track of the progress of individual team members as well entire teams as a whole. There are 3 components to each repo which you need to know before delving into the different repos:

### README.md
Each repository has a README.md file (like this one) which will be filled with information of the team, as well as specific details about the repository structure of that team. These files are edited by the team leads. These files are often the best place to start for people who haven't used that particular repository yet since some repositories may have a slightly different organizational structure than the others. Links to relevant resources are posted on the README files. Since much of the project development happens outside of GitHub it is important to pay attention to the endpoints of these links if you would like to delve a little deeper into the logic of the project progression

### Issues
GitHub issues will be used by the team leads to update and assign tasks to members of their teams. Each of these issues are tagged with specific labels that will describe what kind of issue this is. Leads will also use this platform to make team-wide announcements. This way you can keep up with the project in real time.

### Pull Requests
Pull requests are a way to integrate new files into the repository by the team members. We use pull requests since it makes tracking progress easier, as well as being able to link an open issue to a pull request. This will cause the issue to move from To-Do to Completed and will subsequently close the issue.

### Projects
On the project tab of all the repositories you will find information regarding the different projects this particular team is currently working on. Each project consists of different milestones which can be viewed from the issues tab.

## This repository
This repository will be used to make group-wide announcements and general task assignment. This means that if you follow this repository, you will be able to see the development of the project as a whole.
